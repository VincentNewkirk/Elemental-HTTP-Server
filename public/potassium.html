  <h1>Potassium</h1>
  <h2>K</h2>
  <h3>Atomic number 19</h3>
  <p>Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, kalium) and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the Periodic table, potassium is one of seven elements in column (group) 1 (alkali metals). All elements in Group 1 have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge - a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight[4][5]), and is part of many minerals.</p>
